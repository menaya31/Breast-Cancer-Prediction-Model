This project simulates a data science workflow in a healthcare setting where predictive tools assist doctors in making informed decisions about cancer treatment strategies.

The model is able to,

    predict breast cancer patient's mortality status(Dead or Alive)
    Predcit survival duration in months for those who are not expected to survive

Notebook 1 - Data understanding & Preprocessing 

    Perform exploratory data analysis 
    Identified data quality issues
    Applied and evidenced fixes
    Produced two cleaned tables(classification set & regression set)
    
Notebook 2 - Classification modelling and hyper-parameter tuning

    Built three baseline classifiers
    Evaluated each model
    Choose the best performer and tuned it
    
Notebook 3 - Ensemble learning & Decision Tree Regressor

    Used logistic regression and naive bayes for ensemble classifier
    Built Decision Tree regressors (fully grown and pruned)
    Estimated patient survival time in months
    Evaluated using MSE, MAE, and RÂ²

Technologies & Libraries used 

    Programming Language: Python
    Development Environment: Jupiter Notebooks 
    Core Libraries: Pandas(data handling), Matplotlib(Data Visualization), Scikit-learn(Model building and evaluation)
